This dissertation examines the loss of narrative layers in online art collections and explores ways to address this deficit through interface design and curatorial-technical strategies. It is grounded in the author's experience in the digital R&D environment of *lab.SNG*, where publishing infrastructure, development, design, and interpretation intersect. In this context, the online collection often operates primarily as a database: it enables fast access to artworks through search, filters, and isolated records, yet tends to weaken context, adjacency, and the gradual construction of meaning that naturally emerges in physical gallery settings.

Methodologically, the dissertation follows a *research through design* approach: knowledge is produced through design, prototyping, deployment, and critical reflection on concrete solutions. It formulates three research questions: how to enter an online collection beyond search and catalog order; which design and algorithmic strategies can support meaning-making within a database structure; and how to design these strategies so they remain legible, sustainable, and fair to both artworks and visitors. The practical part culminates in an experimental prototype that tests "storytelling from the database" through generated adjacencies, comparisons, and short interpretive links between artworks.

The outcome is a set of transferable principles and recommendations for museums and galleries on how to design online collections that function not only as inventory catalogs, but also as legible entry points into relations, contexts, and meaning.
